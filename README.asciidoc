= Farwest Demo

This project is a reimplementation of Observer using the
https://github.com/ninenines/farwest[Farwest RESTful/HATEOAS Web framework].

This project requires Erlang/OTP 22 or above. To run, do:

``` bash
$ make run
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your favorite browser.

The Observer functionality reimplemented is currently
limited. Similarly, the HATEOAS features are not fully-fledged
yet and require a lot more work.

This project may be renamed and maintained as a Web version
of Observer when Farwest gets closer to completion, depending
on demand. This project is not currently open source, it is
only made public in order to discuss Farwest.
